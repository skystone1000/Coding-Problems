1) Undirected Graph
    a) Adjacency Matrix
    b) Adjacency List


2) Directed Graph
    a) Adjacency Matrix
    b) Adjacency List


Pros and Cons
    a) Adjacency Matrix
        - Easy to represent and Handle
        - Consumes a lot of sapce (Not fit for sparse graph)
        
    b) Adjacency List
        - Not easy to handle
        - Needs linked list and pointer manipulations
        - Takes Low space (Fit for sparse graph)

Note: Adjacency Matrix is good for dense graph due to low space required 
      as compared to the Adjacency list due to pointer overheads
