Sub Problems or Variations
    a) Subset Sum
    b) Equal Sum Partition
    c) Count of subset sum
    d) Minimum subset sum diff
    e) Target sum
    f) Number of subset by given difference

Knapsack Problems
    1) Fractional Knapsack (Greedy approach - Not in DP)
    2) 0-1 Knapsack - Either we can include complete item or exclude it.
    3) Unbounded Knapsack - No limitation of number of items

Question
    Given
    Weights [] : 1    3    4    5
    Values  [] : 1    4    5    7
    Capacity (W) : 7 kg (Capacity of knapsack)
    Find max profit that we can get by adding elements in the bag?

Identification of DP
    1) Choice : (we have a choice to either include or exclude elements)
    2) Optimal : (We are asked about optimal - max, min, largest, smallest)

Method to Approach
    Step a) Recursive Solution
    Step b) Memoization
    Step c) Top Down approach(Table)
