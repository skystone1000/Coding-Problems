// Aditya Verma - DP Playlist 13 Unbounded Knapsack
/*
Knapsack Types
    1) Fractional Knapsack => Solve with greedy method
    2) 0/1 Knapsack
    3) Unbounded Knapsack
        a) Rod Cutting
        b) Coin Change 1
        c) Coin Chnage 2
        d) Maximum ribbon Cut

Differences between 0/1 knapsack and Unbounded knapsack
    - Multiple occurences of same item are allowed in unbounded which is not in 0/1 knapsack
        which is why we may come to an element again once traversed in unbounded but we do not
        consider the element again in 0/1 Knapsack
